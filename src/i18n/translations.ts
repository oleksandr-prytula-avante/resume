      "I’m a Software Engineer with over 10 years of hands-on experience in WEB development across next domains: e-Learning, e-Commerce / Marketplaces, Trading, Insurance and Health Care. I’ve contributed to products in various delivery models - from out-staffing to startups - adapting quickly to diverse workflows, business goals, and team dynamics. I’ve worked both independently and in teams of 3 to 20 engineers, often within international, distributed environments.",
    [ETranslationKey.AboutParagraph2]:
      "As a full-stack developer, I deliver solutions from frontend interfaces to backend services and infrastructure. I’m experienced with monolithic and microservice architectures, REST / GraphQL APIs, databases like MySQL and MongoDB. I actively use Docker and implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment. Additionally, I use testing frameworks such as Playwright and Jest to ensure high code quality and reliability.",
    [ETranslationKey.AboutParagraph3]:
      "My responsibilities include product evaluation and planning, technical estimations, architecture design, and MVP scoping. I collaborate closely with stakeholders to define requirements, select appropriate technologies, and ensure maintainability. I also mentor junior developers, conduct code reviews, and support onboarding. I follow Agile/SCRUM methodologies to enable iterative delivery and maintain high team velocity.",
    [ETranslationKey.AboutParagraph4]:
      "I’m committed to continuous learning and staying current with evolving technologies. I continue applying and expanding this knowledge through challenging production engineering tasks. I regularly solve complex programming and system design problems to sharpen my algorithmic thinking and technical skills.",
    [ETranslationKey.AboutParagraph5]:
      "Also I actively integrate AI-powered tools - such as automated code generation, intelligent testing frameworks, and performance optimization utilities - into my development workflows to boost productivity, reduce manual effort, and improve application scalability.",
